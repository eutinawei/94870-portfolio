# Final Project

## Part I

### Project Outline

1. Summary: 
After leaving Taiwan and came to study in the state, since I'm graduating soon and will be moving around, it's getting harder for me to purchase and store physical bools. Therefore, am I plan to analyze how people's preference for books have changed throughout the years. I am interested in doing research on how ebooks perform, and if people are gradually stopping to read physical books. Also, for the ebooks market, I am curious about how each company like kindel or kobo performs, and how abundant their contents are.

2. structure
* Data & graphs about the distribution and trend of physical and ebooks
* Some analysis about the differences between various ebook platforms, the number of books they own, the number of publishing companies they're collaborating with
* Combine the previous two sections to further analyze the change of people's reading habits

### Initial Sketches




### The Data

There are some relevant data on statista like [E-Books Still No Match for Printed Books](https://www.statista.com/chart/24709/e-book-and-printed-book-penetration/), or [Page Turner: Printed Book Sales Rising Again in the U.S.](https://www.statista.com/chart/27285/printed-book-unit-sales-timeline-united-states/), or [Share of adults who have read an e-book in the last 12 months in the United States from 2011 to 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237070/frequency-of-reading-e-books-on-an-ebook-reader-in-the-united-states/). So far the data I found has been indicating that physical books are still the mainstream type; however, I am also curious about the trends throughout the year, and I am still looking for relevant data toward that.

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Tableau for data visualization and shorthand for digital document.
