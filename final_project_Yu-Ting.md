### Initial Sketches



### The Data

There are a lot of data about social media on [statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/1164/social-networks/#topicHeader__wrapper). I plan to first utilize the data for separate platforms to come up with some graphs to analyze their performance throughout the years. Then I plan to combine and compare them to view the trends. I am also considering analyzing the data by gender and by country to see if the trends differ.

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Tableau for data visualization and shorthand for digital document.
