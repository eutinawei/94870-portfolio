# Final Project

## Part I

### Project Outline

1. Summary: 
I plan to analyze how people's preference for books have changed throughout the years. I am interested in doing research on how ebooks perform, and if people are gradually stopping to read physical books.

2. structure
* Data & graphs about the distribution and trend of physical and ebooks
* Some analysis about the differences between various ebooks brands
* Combine the previous two sections to further analyze the change of people's reading habits

### Initial Sketches




### The Data

There are some relevant data on statista like [E-Books Still No Match for Printed Books](https://www.statista.com/chart/24709/e-book-and-printed-book-penetration/), or [Page Turner: Printed Book Sales Rising Again in the U.S.](https://www.statista.com/chart/27285/printed-book-unit-sales-timeline-united-states/), or [Share of adults who have read an e-book in the last 12 months in the United States from 2011 to 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237070/frequency-of-reading-e-books-on-an-ebook-reader-in-the-united-states/). So far the data I found has been indicating that physical books are still the mainstream type; however, I am also curious about the trends throughout the year, and I am still looking for relevant data toward that.

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Tableau for data visualization and shorthand for digital document.
