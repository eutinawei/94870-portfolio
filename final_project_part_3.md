## Final Writeup

### The Changes I've Made from Part 2 & Intended Audience

Thanks to the interview feedback I received from part 2, I did some modification and updates for part 3. First, when I developed those tableau graphs, I paid more attention to the details, like the title and the subtitle for axis, to see if they made sense and straightforward enough for audience to grasp the meanings immediately. Second, I thought more about the ideas and meanings behind all the graphs: what am I trying to convey? How does these graphs relate to each other and form a smoother story? Third, thanks to the feedback I got from Professor, beside the existing table about the price comparison of the best-selling books in the state, I also added the table about the best-selling books in Taiwan to prove the differences from the books in the US. That makes the whole point I was trying to convey more clearly. Fourth, I also updated my call to action. In part 2, I only suggested people that are interested in e-books to take the pros and cons I mentioned into consideration. However, it's more helpful to straightforwardly indicate what kind of people should opt to buy ebooks and vise versa.

The intended audience for this story would be the people that are curious about e-books and has not try them before, for them to learn about the differences between e-books and print ones. Also, for people that has been reading e-books, they can also learn from this story by understanding that they can buy more affordable options on foreign websites. Lastly, for book sellers/publishers and e-book platforms in the US, through reading this story, they can understand more about the trends throughout the years and consider if they want to join or keep staying in this market.
