# Final Project Part 1

[Home Page](/README.md)

### Project Outline

1. Summary: 
After leaving Taiwan and came to study in the state, since I'm graduating soon and will be moving around, it's getting harder for me to purchase and store physical books. Therefore, I plan to analyze how people's preference for books have changed throughout the years. I am interested in doing research on how ebooks perform, and if people are gradually stopping to read physical books. Also, for the ebooks market, I am curious about how each company like kindle or kobo performs, and how abundant their contents are.

2. structure
* Data & graphs about the distribution and trend of physical and ebooks
* Some analysis about the differences between various ebook platforms, the number of books they own, the number of publishing companies they're collaborating with
* Combine the previous two sections to further analyze the change of people's reading habits

### Initial Sketches

First, I want to see how the physical books and ebooks perform throughout the years to see if ebooks are having a bright prospect. I want to see what people prefers and if the preferences are changing.

Then, I want to see how the ebook market is like right now. How every company is performing.

Then furthermore, I am interested in how those companies have been performing throughout the years. Besides the number of books they own / sold, I am also interested in the number of publishing companies they have been collaborating. Since my native language is Mandarin, I am also curious to see the number of books each company has in terms of different languages and culture.

### The Data

There are some relevant data on statista like [E-Books Still No Match for Printed Books](https://www.statista.com/chart/24709/e-book-and-printed-book-penetration/), or [Page Turner: Printed Book Sales Rising Again in the U.S.](https://www.statista.com/chart/27285/printed-book-unit-sales-timeline-united-states/), or [Share of adults who have read an e-book in the last 12 months in the United States from 2011 to 2019](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237070/frequency-of-reading-e-books-on-an-ebook-reader-in-the-united-states/). So far the data I found has been indicating that physical books are still the mainstream type; however, I am also curious about the trends throughout the year, and I am still looking for relevant data toward that.

### Method and Medium

I plan to use Tableau for data visualization and shorthand for digital document.

### Optional: Call to action

First, I came up with this idea because I wanted to investigate more about different ebook platforms to help me decide what I would like to join and purchase. And it might also be useful to the people that are interested in starting to read ebooks. Then, thanks to my wonderful teammates who gave me extremely useful advice, I believe this can also be helpful to publishing companies to decide whether they want to spend time / money on digital markets.
