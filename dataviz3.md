## Step three: sketch out a solution

I basically took the numbers and turned it into a line graph. I figured it would be useful to visualize the numbers for readers to view the trend. Also, I made different countries to different colors, and I simplify both x-axis and y-axis to a range of number to simplify the graph.

## Step four: Test the solution

1. Student, early 20's
  - Q: Can you tell me what you think this is?
  - A: This is the number of Taiwanese students receiving student visa from some countries from 2012 to 2021 (basically repeating the title)
  - Q: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
  - A: US used to take a lot more of the Taiwanese students, but there was a sharp decline. Other counties are relatively segmented.
  - Q: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
  - A: Except for US, other countries are a bit too small and hard to read.
  - Q: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
  - A: Potential voters in the US? (Why?) Cause the sharp decline seemed to be because of Trump. (Oh I did a poor job wireframing. That line should decline during 2020.) Oh so it's because of covid! Then the audience might be Taiwanese that are looking for visa.
  - Q: Is there anything you would change or do differently?
  - A: I would make the scale of x-axis bigger. Cause currently except the US, all the other countries are gathered together.

2. Student, mid 20's
  -
